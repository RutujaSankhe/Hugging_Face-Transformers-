# Title: Hugging Face(Transformers)
In this project, we can see how to use pre-trained model from transformers to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, question-answering and text summarization etc.
Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train pretrained models. By using pretrained models one can reduce computational costs, saves the time and resources required to train a model from scratch.
